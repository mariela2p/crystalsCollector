Crystal-Collector

A simple game where the user is given a random number at the start of the game, and is presented with 4 different crystals, each crystal has a specific hidden value. By clicking on a crystal the user will add the crystal's value to his total score.

user wins when he matches his score to the random number given at the start of the game and loses once his score becomes more than the random number given.

the value of each crystal is only constant through out a single game, however these values change at the start of each game.
